          Hardware is nothing without software!!! Here are some guides about how
          to use reoccuring software!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

            A computer needing to be imaged or reimaged comes up a lot.
            <p>
              What does this mean? Well, a computer's current state, even the
              state it's in RIGHT NOW could be considered an "image".
            </p>
            <p>
              So let's say you want to take that current state, and put it on
              another computer... and then mass deploy that image on about 105
              classroom computers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Well, that's what the software
              <a href="https://www.acronis.com/en-us/support/trueimage/2021/"
                >ACRONIS</a
              >
              allows you to do! You can capture the image, and then deploy it
              everywhere! Isn't that GREAT!?!!
            </p>
            <p>
              Of course, this guide only covers the fact that Acronis exists and
              can let you image a computer. I can't get too specific into what
              goes into making the image after all.

            For every computer you give away, you must get its identifying
            information first.
            <p>
              This process is made EASY with the use of my inventory
              script!!!!!! <i class="fa-regular fa-eye-slash"></i> I CANNOT
              SHARE THIS BUT I WILL SHOW AN EXAMPLE!
              <i class="fa-regular fa-eye-slash"></i>
            </p>
            <img
              src="../media/images/code.png"
              alt="example of code for the inventory script"
              class="guidePicturesLarge"
            />
            <p>
              The script lets you get all the information you need within a few
              clicks. It could use some modification still to make it quicker,
              but the concept is simple.
            </p>

            <p>
              You run the script, it pulls all the information with many
              different commands, and then exports the results to a nicely
              formatted text document. This provides for easy reading of the
              information, and little interaction with the computer's specifics.

            Computers sometimes won't let you reimage due to how the hard drive
            is set up. This program will help you with that.
            <p>
              So, let's say that for some reason, Acronis from Guide #1 won't
              see the drive that you are trying to write over with an image.
              Lucikly, there is a solution!
            </p>
            <p>
              Since we don't care about what we are wiping over (unless you do,
              if so back up the files before proceeding!), we can nuke the drive
              by using
              <a href="https://gparted.org/download.php">GPARTED</a>. The amd64
              installation is the way to go for most computers.
            </p>
            <p>
              That's usually the quickest way, but there is another solution
              through the use of a
              <a
                href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10"
                >Windows 10 Boot Media.</a
              >
              This lets you get boot tools, and then you can get into a command
              prompt outside the main OS to run a diskpart command.
            </p>
            <p>
              If none of these work, it's possible the BIOS settings of the
              system may need to be adjusted in order to account for a certain
              drive format. This most likely will never be the case if the
              computer was recently already imaged, however.

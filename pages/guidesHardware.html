          Since there are a lot of different pieces of hardware around campus to
          maintain, it's important to keep track of certain guides for them all.

            When a non-classroom computer needs to be swapped, you will need to
            make sure of a few things.
            <ol>
              <li>
                Do they need it? Make sure that there is a reason for swapping a
                client's computer.
              </li>
              <img src="../media/images/thought.jpg" alt="sticky note with a lightbulb on it to symbolize thought" class="guidePictures"/>
              <li>
                Do they know? Make sure that there has been contact with the
                client.
              </li>
              <img src="../media/images/contact.jpg" alt="an old telephone" class="guidePictures" />
              <li>
                Are you prepared? Make sure that you have a form of external
                storage to move their data from their old device to their new
                device.
              </li>
              <img src="../media/images/prepared.jpg" alt="a person prepared for anything" class="guidePictures" />
            </ol>
            <p>
              With the new computer, you will need to make sure it has its own
              name and is on the university's network. Make sure that all of
              this information can be easily tracked down for record purposes.

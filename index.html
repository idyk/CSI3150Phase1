        There are so many IT guides out there that do NOT help with anything
        when it comes to specific things that I have to do for work on campus.
        And even if they do help, they never fully explain anything since the
        hardware can vary greatly between different devices. This website will
        help me organize things that have helped me in specific cases that I
        would have never thought would EVER work. It will amaze me, and it WILL
        amaze you, I am so sure of it. It won't get too crazy though, so don't
        you worry.
